Description and Purpose of the Project
--------------------------------------

This project is a fully functional multilingual Voice Assistant built using Python. 
It supports Arabic and English speech recognition, text-to-speech generation, wake-word activation, 
and real-time interaction through a graphical user interface.

Description:
------------
The application listens to the user’s voice, converts the speech into text, processes the command, 
and responds either using predefined corpus data or by generating AI-powered responses through Gemini 
(if an API key is provided). It also supports opening common websites, answering jokes/facts/greetings, 
and recognizing stop commands. Additionally, the application includes a "Wake Word Mode" that activates 
conversation when the user says a specific keyword such as "يا مساعد" or "hey assistant".

Purpose:
--------
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate a practical implementation of a voice-driven assistant 
using speech recognition and natural language processing techniques. It shows how different Python libraries 
(such as SpeechRecognition, gTTS, Tkinter, and Pygame) can interact to create a seamless user experience.
The project also highlights modular design, multithreading for audio playback, session handling, 
and the integration of AI models for intelligent conversation.

This project can be used for:
- Educational demonstrations in AI and Human-Computer Interaction.
- A foundation for building more advanced assistants in future development.
- Enhancing user accessibility by providing hands-free operation.
- Practical course submissions for AI, NLP, and software development courses.
